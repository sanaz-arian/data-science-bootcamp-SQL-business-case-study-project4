# 📊 Magist database analysis – SQL business case study

This repository contains a complete SQL-based exploration and business analysis of the Magist e-commerce marketplace database.

The project simulates a real-world business scenario where Eniac evaluates whether partnering with Magist is strategically beneficial — especially for high-end tech products and delivery performance.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is divided into three main phases:

1. **Database Understanding**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Business Question Analysis**

All analysis was performed using MySQL and MySQL Workbench.

## 🏗 Database Overview

The Magist database contains transactional marketplace data including:

- Customers
- Sellers
- Products
- Orders
- Order items
- Payments
- Reviews
- Geographic information

The database structure reflects real-world e-commerce operations, where:

- `orders` stores one row per order
- `order_items` stores one row per product inside an order
- `order_payments` stores payment-level details
- `order_reviews` stores customer feedback

Understanding these relationships was essential before performing JOIN operations.

## 🔎 Exploratory Analysis

Initial exploration focused on answering fundamental data questions:

- Total number of orders
- Order status distribution (delivered, cancelled, unavailable, etc.)
- Monthly and yearly order growth
- Number of available products
- Product distribution across categories
- Products actually involved in transactions
- Minimum and maximum product prices
- Minimum and maximum payment values

This phase helped build a high-level understanding of the dataset.

## 💼 Business Questions Addressed

The analysis focused on two strategic concerns:

### 1️⃣ High-End Tech Product Fit

- What tech product categories exist?
- How many tech products were sold?
- What percentage of total sales do they represent?
- What is the average selling price?
- Are expensive tech products popular?
- What percentage of sellers are tech-focused?
- Revenue generated by tech sellers vs overall sellers

### 2️⃣ Delivery Performance

- Average delivery time
- On-time vs delayed deliveries
- Patterns in delayed orders
- Relationship between product type and delivery delay
